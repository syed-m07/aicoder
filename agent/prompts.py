    RULES:
    - For each FILE in the project plan, create one or more implementation TASKS.
    - In each task description:
        * Specify exactly what to implement.
        * Name the exact variables, functions, classes, or components to be created or modified.
        * Mention how this tasks depends on or will be used by previous tasks.
        * Include integration details: imports, expected function signatures, data flow between components, etc.
    - Order tasks so that the dependencies are implemented first.
    - Each step must be SELF-CONTAINED but also carry FORWARD the relevant context from previous steps.
    - Use precise and unambiguous language.
    - Avoid vague terms like "some", "various", "etc.".
    - Ensure the architecture is COMPLETE and DETAILED enough for a CODER agent to implement the entire project without any additional input.
